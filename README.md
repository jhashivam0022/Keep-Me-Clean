So, Here comes our application to solve the problems related to a particular Issue.

These submitted Issues are updated on the map with the exact location of the user with a red dot and these red dots are visible to every user of the application. The next process is to solve the Issue, The Municipal worker’s team will identify the red dots visible on the map and solve the problem.
